The article says if you want to get frustrated, you need to, uh, have a programmer's mindset, what is a programmer's mindset?
First, you have to define the goal of the program and not increase the complexities, and because the increases are not desirable in programming, your program should be simple and free of complications.
You have to be able to maintain it in the future in the present as the program would prefer to be consistent where everyone understands what I want to write
Prioritization is an integral part of the programmer's mindset until it reduces time and effort
Prioritization is an integral part of the programmer's mindset so that it reduces time and effort. A good programmer also predicts the future of what will happen by making correct assumptions. Do not invent new things unless the need arises. Testing the code will make it easier for you to solve problems in the future. Not all of you.
